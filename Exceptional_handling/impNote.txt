Exception handling is used when the frequency of occurance of an exception cannot be predicted.

==>real world examples:

   1) you provide a web form for users to fill in and submit.but incase there are a lot of conditions to be handled and the conditions keeps changing periodically,you use exception handling to simplify the process

   2) database connectivity uses exception handling(why???) this is because the reason for database connectivity failure cannot be predicted and handled as it can be caused by many variables 
    such as power failure, unreachable server,failure at client front/back end and so on.

   3) internet communication

   4) arithmetic exceptions such as division by zero and so on.

   5) operating systems use exception handling to resolve deadlocks,recover from crash and so forth
